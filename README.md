I transformed raw healthcare data into meaningful insights using Power BI.
The dashboard included cards to display inpatient and outpatient numbers, slicers for year and hospital type, and a matrix chart showing total discharges and expenses by hospital type.
I also utilized a clustered column chart to visualize year-wise bed availability, a ribbon chart to track bad debt over the years, and a slicer for CEO analysis.
An area chart highlighted hospital-wise bad debt, and a line graph illustrated the average length of stay per year. 
This project provided comprehensive insights for healthcare management and decision-making.
